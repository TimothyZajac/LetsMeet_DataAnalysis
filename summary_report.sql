-- 2. Is LetsMeet membership leveling off?

/*
- Based on the available data, LetsMeet membership does appear to be leveling off. 
- Overall, LetsMeet only added 363 more new members in 2017 over the number of new members in 2016. 
That's a growth of approximately 3.5%. 
- By comparison, LetsMeet's growth in the number of new members over the previous years was 1,900 in 2016,
4,452 in 2015, 1009 in 2014, and 993 in 2013.
- Looking at the number of new members each month of 2017, LetsMeet added between 900 and 1,100 new 
members in each of the first 10 months of 2017. The number of new memebers dropped significantly in 
November and December to just 223 and 12 respectively for those two months. This is likely due to those 
months being the Holiday Season where people are preoccupied with events with family, friends, work 
colleagues etc. 
- There is a significant decrease in the number of new members added in 2017 in each of three major 
cities and their surrounding areas. 
- New York added only 442 more new members in 2017 than in 2016, wiich was approximatley 50% less than 
the number of new members added over the previous year. 
- San Francisco experienced a significant decrease in number of new members in 2017. There were just 27 
more new members added in 2017 after adding 383 in 2016 and 1,188 in 2015 from previous years. 
- Chicago experienced a decrease in new members in 2017, adding 105 fewer new members in 2017 than in 
2016. 
- One issue to highlight is that the available data for new members stopped at 2017. There is no data 
on new members from 2018 to present. The reason for this is unknown. It would be worth examining this 
as data on new members from these years would help provide additional information on the state of new
membership.

-- 3. What five groups should marketing feature in their upcoming campaign?*

/*
I recommend that the following 5 groups be featured:

1. NYC Art Meetup
- Of the 745 groups with a 5 star rating, this group has the most members at 9082.
- Recommended as one of the 3 to feature from New York.
- The category is Arts & Culture. 

2. NYC Local Singles and Professionals Get Togethers
- This group had the second highest number of members at 5776. 
- This would be the second group from New York. 
- Category is Food and Drink

3. Create and Chat
- This group has a 5 star rating and is the 5th in group membership at 2752.
- This will be the thrid group recommended from New York.
- This group is from the Hobbies & Crafts category. 
- The group with the 3rd highest membership was from the category Photography and was from
New York. I eliminated this group because it was closely related to NYC Art Meetup and would
not contribute to a variety of group categories that is desired. 
- Chicago Young Professionals - Business, Social & Tech Events from the Socializing category is 
the group with the 4th highest membership. I eliminated it because it appeared closely related to 
NYC Local Singles and Professionals Get Togethers and would not provide variety in groups featured.  

4. The Chicago Entrepreneurs
- This group has a 5 star rating and is the group thats number 10 in terms of overall membership at 2265 
members.
- This is the group recommended to represent Chicago. Two other groups from Chicago with 5 star ratings 
had higher membership but were not recommended because they were from categories already represented. 
- All other groups were also from New York, which already fully represented. 

5. San Francisco- The Machine Learning Conference
- This group has a 5 star rating and is number 15 in terms of membership at 2051.
- This group is from the Tech category. 
- This is the group recommended to represent San Francisco. There is only one other group with a 5 star 
rating from San Francisco with a higher group membership. It was also from the Tech category, but 
the name of the group, Sketch & Design - San Francisco, gave the appearence that it was closly related
to the Arts category which is already present.
- In addition, all other groups with a 5 star rating and higher membership were from New York and Chicago
which are already selected.
